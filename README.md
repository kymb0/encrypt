# Overview
encrypt is a small utility which was initially created for shellcode protection, but has since been adapted to protect arbitrary strings. encrypt can take one or more comma-separated strings, or any raw position independent shellcode and encrypt it. Encryption takes place using AES-256 with a user-supplied or randomly generated alphanumeric key, salt and/or initialization value. encrypt then outputs a decryption routine in either C# or C/C++ to file or CLI, depending on what is selected.

## Why?
encrypt was inspired after taking the [Sektor7 RTO Malware Development Essentials](https://institute.sektor7.net/red-team-operator-malware-development-essentials) course, which I cannot recommend enough. Shellcode aside, encrypting strings can be quite useful when you are hiding certain function calls from the IAT (function call obfuscation). This is a well-known practice when evading endpoint security. For example, if you want to call `QueueUserApc`, you will need to bring in the function prototype and create a pointer like `pQueueUserApc = GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle("kernel32.dll"),"QueueUserApc");`. While this will remove `QueueUserApc` from the IAT, scanning engines can still do the equivilent of `strings` and find that `QueueUserApc` is in the compiled PE as it is a cleartext string. Thatâ€™s the long way around for saying - if you need to call function names, you should probably encrypt them.

# Usage
You can grab a copy of encrypt from the [releases](https://github.com/skahwah/encrypt/releases/) page. Alternatively, feel free to compile the solution yourself. encrypt relies on the `templates` folder being in the same directory as `encrypt.exe` (a check is done at runtime). This has also been made available on the releases page.

The following input types are supported:
- **File:** A raw/binary position independent shellcode file, such as a Cobalt Strike `beacon.bin`. This can be supplied either by it's current, relative, or full path.
- **String:** One or more arbitrary strings that are comma-separated.

```
C:\Users\skawa\Desktop\encrypt> encrypt.exe -h

Examples:
        encrypt.exe -l cs -m file -i C:\test\beacon.bin -e random -o file
        encrypt.exe -l cpp -m string -i VirtualAlloc,LoadLibrary -e manual -k oC95@#Qy -s 2cVMpO!0 -v cf8U4v%M -o cli

Language (-l):
        -l cpp - Create C/C++ encrypted output
        -l cs - Create C# encrypted output

Mode (-m):
        -m file - Read in a raw/binary position independent shellcode file
        -m string - Read in one or more comma-seperated strings

Input (-i):
        -i C:\test\beacon.bin
        -i VirtualAlloc,LoadLibrary

Encryption Type (-e):
        -e random - Randomly generate a alphanyumeric key, salt and initialization value
        -e manual - Manually supply a alphanumeric key, salt and initialization value. This requires the following three arguments:
                 -k Password123
                 -s Salt123
                 -v InitVal123

Ouput (-o):
        -o cli - Ouput to CLI
        -o file - Output to template files
        
        .\encrypt.exe -l cpp -m string -i VirtualAllocEx,WriteProcessMemory,CreateRemoteThread,VirtualAlloc,CreateToolhelp32Snapshot,kernel32.dll,explorer.exe,Process32Next,Process32First,OpenProcess,CloseHandle,FindResourceA,LoadResource,LockResource,SizeofResource,RtlMoveMemory,WaitForSingleObject -e manual -k Password -s Salt -v InitVal123 -o file
        
```

```

If you look at the first line of the output file, you will find the necessary commands to compile the payload. In cases where the output option is set to `file`, the template file will have a vanilla injection routine which is designed just to test if the decryption routine (which is what you really want) works. If the output option is set to `cli`, the decryption routine will not be printed to screen (to save space). This can be pulled from the corresponding templates file in the `templates` directory.
